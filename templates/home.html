                                        <strong>"What Do I Say When Asked About Jesus?"</strong> is a conversational approach to answering the “what do I say?” 
                                        question that so many people ask. Will we respond to our call to share the gospel with others? 
                                        Or will we shy away from sharing because of fear? This overview of the basics of the Christian 
                                        faith provides an easy to remember outline for sharing the gospel and the encouragement needed to 
                                        include our own unique stories as part of the sharing. Full of anecdotes and examples shared 
                                        from a life of service in the church, “What Do I Say When Asked About Jesus?” is a tool to 
                                        help the everyday Christian share the gospel with others.

                                    by Dave Foucar’s new book, “What Do I Say When Asked About Jesus? A Layman’s Perspective on 
                                    Personal Evangelism and the Basics of the Christian Faith.” This easy to read book describes 
                                    how average people in the church can know the basics of the Gospel and share their faith effectively. 
                                    The examples are from years of real life experiences sharing the Gospel. Dave is biblically solid, 
                                    his applications are practical and sensitive to people who have questions. 
                                    This book is very suitable for personal spiritual growth or as a small group or leadership development resource."

                                    We feel nervous, we don’t want rejection, and maybe we feel inadequate in our knowledge. 
                                    If that is you, this book is a an excellent training guide. 
                                    The author covers the important topics of why we are to share our faith, why it is our command, 
                                    and why people will want to hear. He then provides an outline for sharing your faith that is 
                                    practical and easy to use. Finally, he offers advice on what to do after you help lead someone 
                                    to Christ because the decision is not the end of the journey but only the beginning of a new journey. 
                                    I recommend this book to encourage you in obedience to share with others what God has given you."

                                    “What Do I Say When Asked About Jesus” is an insightful and practical tool for helping Christians 
                                    in sharing their faith with others. Dave writes in such a way to be understood by both Christians 
                                    and non-Christians alike, and his approach is genuine, honest and loving. It is easy reading but 
                                    is a strong reminder of who we are, what our purpose is, and how we should go about sharing our faith. 
                                    It is a reminder that we all have a story about the night and day difference that Jesus has made 
                                    in our lives, and those stories are meant to be shared with others.
                                    I would recommend this book to any Christian who is looking for ways to share their faith, 
                                    to any small group wanting to make a difference, and to any non-Christian who is looking for 
                                    answers about who Jesus is and/or who Christ followers are.

                                    "I strongly recommend this book for those looking to engage others in conversations about Christ. 
                                    In a well written book, Dave presents an easy to follow model for preparing, sharing and following 
                                    up on those people we care about knowing Christ. Each of his steps can be easily memorized and used, 
                                    and for each one he provides a large amount of Scripture and a number of Biblical principles on 
                                    how our role is to start the conversation, and the Holy Spirit's job to convict and convert. 
                                    This book would be good for small groups or Sunday School classes (what appears to be its genesis) 
                                    and will leave the readers more confident."
